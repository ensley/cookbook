      unit: tbsp
      ingredient: sesame seeds (optional)
    - quantity: 2 - 3
      unit: tbsp
      ingredient: poppy seeds (optional)

instructions:
  - In a small bowl, place the yeast, 1/2 teaspoon sugar, and lukewarm water. Stir gently to mix. Allow to sit **5 to 10 minutes**, until it becomes foamy on top.
  - In a large bowl or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, mix together 1 1/2 cups of the flour, salt, and 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar. Add the water-yeast mixture and oil to flour. Mix thoroughly.
  - Add another 1 cup of the flour and eggs and mix until smooth. Switch to the dough hook attachment if you are using a stand mixer.
  - Add another 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the flour and mix thoroughly. Then remove dough from the bowl and place on a floured surface. Knead the remaining 1/2 cup flour into dough, continuing to knead for about **5 minutes**.
  - Place dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel. Allow to rise at least **3 hours**.
  - Divide the dough in two and braid the challahs into desired shape.
  - Place braided challah on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or silicone baking mat. Allow the challah to rise another **45 to 60 minutes**, or until you can see the size has grown and the challah seems light. This step is very important to ensure a light and fluffy challah. Preheat over to 375Â°F while the dough rises.
  - In a small bowl beat 2 egg yolks with 1 teaspoon water. Brush the egg wash liberally over the challah. Sprinkle with sea salt, sesame seeds, and/or poppy seeds if desired.
  - Bake **24 to 26 minutes**, or until the color is golden.

This recipe is from *Modern Jewish Baker: Challah, Babka, Bagels & More* by Shannon Sarna.

The high altitude really seems to mess with this recipe. I've had trouble with the dough being super sticky and not coming together. Sometimes I can save it by adding an extra half a cup or so of flour, but not always. If you're at altitude, good luck.
