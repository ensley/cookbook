ingredients:
  - quantity: 6
    ingredient: fresh chiles (ancho or Anaheim)
  - quantity: 1/2
    unit: lb
    ingredient: Oaxaca cheese
  - quantity: 1/4
    unit: cup
    ingredient: flour
  - quantity: 6
    ingredient: eggs (separated)
  - quantity: 4
    unit: cup
    ingredient: salsa (any kind)
  - quantity: 1
    unit: cup
    ingredient: corn oil

instructions:
  - Preheat the oven broiler and rinse the chiles. Place the chiles in a 9 x 14 baking dish and place on the top rack of the oven.
  - Watch and listen closely. When the skins start to make popping sounds and char and turn black in places, take the chiles out and flip them over.
  - When both sides are evenly charred, remove them from the oven. Place the chiles in a sealed plastic bag to steam (or wrap them individually in a moist paper towel).
  - Check after a few minutes. Once the skin comes off easily, peel each chile.
  - Cut a slit almost the full length of each chile. Make a small "t" across the top, by the stem. Pull out fibers and seeds and replace with cheese. If necessary, pin the chiles closed with toothpicks.
  - Whip the egg whites at high speed with an electric mixer until stiff peaks have formed.
  - Heat the oil in a skillet until a drop of water sizzles when dropped into the pan.
  - Beat the egg yolks with one tablespoon flour and salt. Fold the yolk mixture into the whites until a thick paste forms.
  - Roll the chiles in 1/4 cup flour and dip each one in the egg batter. Coat evenly. Fry on both sides until golden brown. Place on paper towels to drain.
  - While the chiles are frying, heat the salsa in a medium saucepan. Plate the chiles and pour salsa over them. Serve immediately.

This recipe comes from [MexGrocer.com](https://www.mexgrocer.com/534-killer-chiles-rellenos.html).

The chiles can be prepared ahead of time if necessary. Once they have been seeded and stuffed with cheese, they can be put in the refrigerator for a few hours.

We had trouble keeping the cheese contained in the chiles, so we held them closed with toothpicks and fried them with the toothpicks inside. If you do this you won't be able to see them underneath the fluffy batter, so be careful not to eat them!
