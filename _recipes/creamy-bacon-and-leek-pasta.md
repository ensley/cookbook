This recipe is from Southern Living's *5-Ingredient Weeknight Meals: Delicious Dinners in 30 Minutes or Less*, page 117.

We've had issues with the pasta getting kind of gross when it's reheated the next night. When we're making this for two nights, we'll cook only enough pasta for the first night and set half the sauce aside. Then on night 2, we cook some more pasta and warm up the leftover sauce in a saucepan, and it ends up being just as good as it was the first night.
