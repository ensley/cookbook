This is a great hearty meal. We made this one snowy 18-degree day in October, which is a thing that happens in Colorado I guess, and it was exactly what we needed. The recipe is from *The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook*, page 338, but we made some modifications. We use a storebought crust instead of the made-from-scratch one in the recipe, and we use fresh carrots rather than frozen and corn rather than peas, because peas are gross.
