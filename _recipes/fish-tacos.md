instructions:
  - Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
  - In a large cast iron skillet, heat the oil over medium heat until it shimmers.
  - Cut the fish into 1- to 2-inch strips and pat with a paper towel to dry.
  - In a large bowl, combine all batter ingredients.
  - Toss the fish in the batter until fish is thoroughly coated on all sides.
  - Working in batches if necessary, place the fish in a single layer in the heated oil. Fry for **3 to 5 minutes** or until the bottoms are golden brown.
  - Flip the fish and fry for an additional **3 to 5 minutes** or until the pieces are evenly golden brown on all sides. Move the fish from the skillet to a plate with a paper towel on it to absorb the excess oil.
  - Spread the tortillas on a baking sheet and brush them with a very thin layer of oil. Put them in the oven for a few minutes to warm.
  - In a medium bowl, combine all sauce ingredients.
  - Assemble the tacos with the fish, mango, radishes, cabbage, cilantro, avocado, and sauce.

One of our favorites. Serve with a generous-sized margarita for best results.

We've probably made six versions of these fish tacos, but this is more or less the recipe we've converged on. The taco fillings can be subbed out for other things, but it's important to have a good mix of soft and crunchy to go with the crispy fried fish. The combination we use of mango and avocado (soft) and radishes and cabbage (crunchy) are not only balanced in texture, but also compliment the delicate flavor of the fish without completely overwhelming it.
