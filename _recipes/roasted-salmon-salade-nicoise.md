instructions:
  - Heat the oven to **400°F** and place a rack near the top of the oven. Place the potatoes on a sheet pan, add 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and toss. Arrange the potatoes so the cut sides are facing down and roast for **20 minutes**.
  - While the potatoes roast, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Add the eggs and cook over medium heat for exactly **6 minutes**. Remove the eggs, and when they are cool enough to handle, peel and quarter them.
  - "Make the dressing: In a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Slowly whisk in 4 tablespoons of olive oil and set aside."
  - Add the green beans and tomatoes to the sheet pan with the potatoes, along with 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Using tongs, toss well, then move the vegetables to the sides to create space in the center of the sheet pan. Pat the salmon fillets dry with a paper towel and place them, skin-side down, in the center of the sheet pan.
  - Brush fillets with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard, and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Roast on the top rack in the overn for **10 minutes**. Turn the broiler to high and broil for **2 to 3 minutes** to lightly brown the salmon.
  - Add the greens to the large bowl with the dressing, and toss gently. Place greens on a large platter, leaving a narrow border at the platter's edges. Place the salmon fillets in the middle of the platter, then arrange the roasted vegetables and eggs around them. Sprinkle with salt and serve.

We tried this from [NYT Cooking](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020220-sheet-pan-roasted-salmon-nicoise-salad) and really liked it. We leave out the olives. Salmon doesn't reheat very well, so we'll make half the salmon (2 fillets) on the first night and then roast the rest by itself the next night and reheat the leftover vegetables.
