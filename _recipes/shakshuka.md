  - quantity: 4
    ingredient: eggs
  - ingredient: feta cheese
  - ingredient: crusty bread, for serving

instructions:
  - Heat olive oil in a sauté pan over high heat until shimmering. Add onion, bell pepper, and jalapeño and spread into an even layer. Cook without moving until vegetables on the bottom are deeply browned and beginning to char in spots, about **6 minutes**. Stir and repeat. Continue to cook until vegetables are fully softened and spottily charred, about another **4 minutes**.
  - Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about **30 seconds**. Add paprika and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about **30 seconds**. Immediately add tomatoes and stir to combine.
  - Reduce heat to a bare simmer and simmer for **10 minutes**, then season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in half of cilantro.
  - Using a large spoon, make a well near the perimeter of the pan and break an egg directly into it. Spoon a little sauce over edges of egg white to partially submerge and contain it, leaving yolk exposed. Repeat with remaining eggs, working around pan as you go. Season eggs with a little salt, cover, reduce heat to lowest setting, and cook until egg whites are barely set and yolks are still runny, **5 to 8 minutes**.
  - Sprinkle with remaining cilantro and feta cheese. Serve immediately with crusty bread.
