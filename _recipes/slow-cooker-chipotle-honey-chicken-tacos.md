From the New York Times Cooking section. Serve with the toppings here or whatever taco toppings you like. We like to add some cotija and/or sour cream as well.

**Tip:** For quick pickled onions, thinly slice some red onion and put it in a bowl. Boil about 1 1/2 cups of white or apple cider vinegar, add 3 heaping spoonfuls of sugar, a big pinch of salt, and a big pinch of red pepper flakes, and stir until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Pour the hot vinegar over the onions in the bowl and let them cool to room temperature. They can be used right away or stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
